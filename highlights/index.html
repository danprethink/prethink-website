<h2 id=-prototype-financial-health-app>üì± Prototype: financial health app</h2>
<p>An advisor-tech wanted to turn their in-house models for financial health into a web & mobile app.</p>
<p>After 4 months of collaboration they had a working prototype web-app, a stronger conceptual model, a extentable design system, and began using it in pitches to prospect partners and grant funding.</p>

<h2 id=-self-service-game-changer>üòï Self-service game changer</h2>
<p>Analysis showed that around 90% of customer service inbounds were for features that already existed in the app. How could we help customers self-sevice and discover these features?</p>
<p>I designed two features that increased feature discovery: (i) a library of educational &ldquo;tips&rdquo; displayed during loading screens and (ii) an in-app deep FAQ search.</p>
<p>Customer service loads on these items dropped by 55%.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=-customer-qualitative-insights-at-scale>üå°Ô∏è Customer qualitative insights at scale</h2>
<p>While it&rsquo;s easy to see <em>what</em> customers do, it&rsquo;s often harder to understand <em>why</em> they did it.</p>
<p>I helped design up a decision journaling feature that let customers annotate actions. The value to clients was that it was easy to remember why a transaction was done, and share that info across household members.</p>
<p>We then set up an automated monitoring system to look for novel keywords, trends and insights in anonymized, client entered data.</p>

<h2 id=-risk-profiling-process-audit--revamp>üìà Risk profiling process audit & revamp</h2>
<p>A large US advisor-tech platform wanted to refresh their risk-profiling process. Over the course of 6 weeks I interviewed internal stakeholders and generate an interactive prototype to walk through, as well as a supporting methodology document for regulatory backup.</p>
