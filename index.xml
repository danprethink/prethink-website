ðŸ“± Prototype: financial health app An advisor-tech wanted to turn their in-house models for financial health into a web &amp;amp; mobile app.
After 4 months of collaboration they had a working prototype web-app, a stronger conceptual model, a extentable design system, and began using it in pitches to prospect partners and grant funding.
ðŸ˜• Self-service game changer Analysis showed that around 90% of customer service inbounds were for features that already existed in the app.</description></item><item><title>Services</title><link>https://www.prethink.io/services/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.prethink.io/services/</guid><description>Services It's always dangerous to say what you do, in case people think you don't want to try new things.

PreThink was founded by Dan Egan (me) in 2021 to help with on a wide array of personal finance and investing.
I've worked at Betterment since 2013 on how the design of personal finance apps influences behavior. I love helping create new digital tools, data visualiations, science fiction, dogs, and snowboarding.
I studied economics and decision science, finishing my MSc in 2005. I've collaborated on a few academic papers, done a lot of public speaking and press, and some pretty cool coding.</description></item></channel></rss>
