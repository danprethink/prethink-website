      <title>Low cost is better than free</title>

      <description>I blame Jack Bogle.
His ‘cost matters’ message was honed so finely to a simple effective point that it dominated the fund industry for decades. Fund costs fell relentlessly.
So we hit the logical conclusion: nothing is lower cost than ‘free’! We now have free trades, free index funds, and ‘free’ financial advice.
Yet, ‘free’ can be a poison wrapped in chocolate. When something is ‘free’ the incentives for both the consumer and provider change dramatically, often in ways that are invisibly worse for consumers.</description>

      <description>Some wins, some failures. Over the course of a decade at Betterment, I had a fair mix of successful successes, and successful failures. Betterment has been crafted to help people save and invest easily. I&amp;rsquo;ve influenced the design of web and smartphone app interface, portfolios and strategies, are intelligently designed to make good behavior automatic, and bad behavior difficult. As a result, Betterment’s customers have the lowest behavior gap I know of.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.  Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

      <description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&amp;rsquo;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve been making websites.” — Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1
 Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid TABLE.</description>

      <description>Formspree makes it easy to receive submissions from HTML forms on your static website.  Functional Form This theme has a form-to-email feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (/content/forms/contact.md). Of course, the example shown below (your@email.here) must not be used. Please use your actual email address.</description>
