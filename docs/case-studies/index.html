      I worked with an advisor-tech provider to take their in-house models for financial health and create a prototype web & mobile app using <a href = https://flutter.dev/>Flutter</a>.

      Why are 95% of users bouncing after logging in? Funnily enough, bWe helped design a task and content delivery system to give users productive actions to take or content to read, increasing NPS significantly.

      Around 90% of it's customer service inbounds were for features that already existed in the app. How can we help customers self-sevice</p>      
      <p class="measure-wide lh-copy cf">I designed two features that increased feature discovery, and decreased customer service load by 45%:<br/> (i) a library of educational "tips" displayed during loading screens and <br/>(ii) an in-app deep FAQ search . </br>

    <h4 class="f4 mt4 lh-title">Qualitative insights at scale</h4>
    <p class="measure-wide lh-copy cf">
        While it's easy to see <i>what</i> customers do, it's often harder to understand <i>why</i> they did it.</p>
        <p class="measure-wide lh-copy cf">I helped design up a decision journaling feature that let customers annotate their changes. The value to clients was that it was easy to remember why a transaction was done, and share that info across household members. </p>
        <p class="measure-wide lh-copy cf">
        We then set up an automated monitoring system to look for keywords, trends and insights in anonymized, client entered data. 
      I developed a advice framework based on personality mappings to portfolio construction, ran the training program
      for advisors, wrote commentary and did press.

      A large US advisor-tech platform wanted to refresh their risk-profiling process. Over the course of 6 weeks I interviewed internal stakeholders and generate an interactive prototype to walk through, as well as a supporting methodology document for regulatory backup.
