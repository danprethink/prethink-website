  <p>Many investors make mistakes when it comes to taxes - they actively trade in taxable accounts compared to tax-advantaged accounts, and realize short-term capital gains when long-term treatment would be preferable.</p>

  <p>In a field experiment we show the effect of highlighting tax consequences of portfolio allocation
    changes <b>before </b>investors commit to the change. Allocation changes drop significantly when investors are notified of potential taxes owed.</p>

    <p class="measure-wide lh-copy cf">
      What makes investor's happy with their performance, and how well do they optimize their own expected happiness?
    </p>
    <p>Key factors include how much risk they took, their objectives, investment horizon, confidence, and other
      personal
      factors. </p>
    <p>People are pretty accurate in their forecasts, and rarely are investors unhappy with outcomes
      they predicted they would be happy with.</p>
    <p> However, experienced happiness is only partially predicted by the factors people believe will be important. In
      particular, relative performance plays an important role investors do not anticipate. Having outperformed other
      people contributes to investor happiness, as does active trading success.

    <h4 class="f4 mt4 mb2 lh-title">The meerkat effect: Personality and market returns affect investors’ portfolio
      monitoring behaviour<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268114002145"> ↗️ </a></h4>
    <p class="measure-wide lh-copy cf">
      Do investors change how they monitor their investments depending on what the market has done recently?</p>
    <p>Using data from a online brokerage we find that investors increase their portfolio monitoring following both positive and daily negative market
      returns, behaving more like hyper-vigilant meerkats than head-in-the-sand ostriches. This pattern persists for
      logins not resulting in trades and weekend logins when markets are closed. </p>
    <p>Moreover, a personality trait – neuroticism – moderates portfolio monitoring.

      Do people take other peopled expectations into account when investing?</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>What investors believe other people believe stock market returns will be influences their own investment
      decisions.
      These second-order beliefs have a positive effect on investing beyond own risk and return expectations...</p>
    <p>... but they are inaccurate and exhibit several well-known psychological biases.
    </p>
    <p>First and second-order beliefs differ greatly despite the fact that investors have only a vague idea what
      other participants are thinking.
      Among the biases we observe is investors' belief that their own opinion is relatively more common among the
      population and that others who hold divergent expectations are biased.
