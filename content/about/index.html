      PreThink was founded by <a href="www.dpegan.com">Dan Egan</a> (me) in 2021 to help with on a wide array of
      personal finance and investing.</p>

    <p class="f4 measure-wide lh-copy">I've worked at <a
        href="https://www.betterment.com/invite/danielegan">Betterment</a> since 2013 on how the design of personal
      finance apps influences behavior.


    <p class="f4 measure-wide lh-copy">I love helping create new digital tools, data visualiations, science fiction,
      dogs, and snowboarding.</p>

    <p class="f4 measure-wide lh-copy">I studied economics and decision science, finishing my MSc in 2005. I've
      collaborated on a few academic papers, done a lot of public speaking and press, and some pretty cool coding.

    <h2>Why "PreThink?"</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <code>
      "He can look ahead. See what's coming. He can - <emph>prethink</emph>. Let's call it that. He can see into the
      future. Probably he doesn't perceive it as the future." <br /><br />

      "No," Anita said thoughtfully. "It would seem like the present. He has a broader present. But his present lies
      ahead, not back. <br /><br />Our present is related to the past. Only the past is certain, to us. To him, the future is
      certain. And he probably doesn't remember the past, any more than any animal remembers what happened." <br /><br />
    </code>
